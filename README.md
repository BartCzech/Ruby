# Ruby Course Projects - [**The Odin Project Ruby Course**](theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby)

## Overview
Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed as part of The Odin Project's Ruby Course. This comprehensive course allowed me to dive deep into the Ruby programming language, equipping me with essential knowledge in object-oriented design, testing, and data structures.

## What I Learned

### Mastery of Ruby
Throughout this course, I've gained a solid understanding of the Ruby programming language. I can confidently work with fundamental data types, variables, and control structures. I've also developed proficiency in handling data structures like arrays and hashes and have leveraged these skills to solve real-world problems.

### Object-Oriented Programming
The course delved into object-oriented programming (OOP), a crucial concept in software development. I've applied OOP principles to create projects like Tic Tac Toe and Mastermind, where I designed and implemented classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. These projects showcase my ability to create clean and maintainable code.

### File Handling and Serialization
I've learned to work with files and serialization, which is vital for saving and loading data in applications. Projects like Event Manager and Hangman required me to read and write files, demonstrating my ability to manage data persistence.

### Advanced Ruby Concepts
The course introduced me to more advanced Ruby concepts, including pattern matching and working with blocks. These skills enable me to write more efficient and expressive code. Additionally, I've implemented custom enumerables, a testament to my understanding of Ruby's core features.

### Computer Science Fundamentals
Beyond Ruby, I've gained insights into computer science fundamentals such as recursion, time complexity, space complexity, and common data structures and algorithms. I've applied these principles in projects like Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, and Knights Travails, showcasing my problem-solving abilities.

### Git Proficiency
I've become proficient in using Git for version control. This allows me to collaborate effectively with other developers and contribute to projects seamlessly.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
I've adopted a test-driven development (TDD) approach, leveraging the RSpec testing framework. This ensures that my code is robust, maintainable, and thoroughly tested. The Connect Four project, developed following TDD principles, exemplifies my commitment to delivering high-quality software.
